# Lease Duration Removal and Monthly Rent Rollover Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the changes made to remove lease duration from the booking submission logic and implement a monthly rent calculation system on a rollover basis.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Changes

#### Removed Columns from `bookings` table:
- `lease_duration` - No longer needed as rent is calculated monthly
- `total_rent` - No longer calculated upfront

#### Added Column to `bookings` table:
- `monthly_rent` - Reference field for monthly rent amount

#### Migration File Created:
- `database/remove_lease_duration.sql` - SQL script to update existing database

### 2. API Changes (`api/book.php`)

#### Removed:
- Lease duration validation
- Total rent calculation based on lease duration
- Lease duration from required fields
- Lease duration from database insert

#### Updated:
- Booking insertion to only include essential fields
- Response to remove total_rent reference

### 3. Booking Form Changes (`views/booking/form.php`)

#### Removed:
- Lease end date display
- Rental period selection
- Subtotal calculation based on lease duration
- Hidden rental_period field

#### Updated:
- Pricing summary to show only monthly rent and security deposit
- Total due calculation: Monthly rent + Security deposit (2 months)
- Added informational text about monthly rollover rent calculation
- Simplified JavaScript calculations

### 4. Booking Controller Changes (`controllers/BookingController.php`)

#### Removed:
- `rental_period` from required fields validation
- `calculateTotalAmount()` method
- End date parameter from `isPropertyAvailable()` method

#### Updated:
- Property availability check to only check move-in date
- Validation logic to remove lease duration requirements

### 5. New Rent Calculation System

#### Created `controllers/RentCalculationController.php`:
- **Monthly Rent Calculation**: Calculates rent monthly on rollover basis
- **Balance Accumulation**: Unpaid rent from previous month accumulates to current month
- **Payment Tracking**: Tracks payments and balances per month
- **Invoice Generation**: Creates monthly rent invoices

#### Key Features:
- `calculateMonthlyRent()` - Main calculation method
- `getPreviousMonthBalance()` - Gets unpaid balance from previous month
- `recordRentPayment()` - Records rent payments
- `generateMonthlyInvoice()` - Creates monthly invoices

### 6. Process Booking Updates (`process_booking.php`)

#### Updated:
- Uses new `RentCalculationController` instead of `RentPaymentController`
- Generates first month's invoice after successful booking

## New Rent Calculation Logic

### Monthly Rollover System:
1. **Monthly Rent**: Fixed amount per month (property price)
2. **Previous Balance**: Any unpaid rent from previous month
3. **Current Payments**: Payments made in current month
4. **Total Due**: Monthly rent + Previous balance - Current payments

### Example:
- Month 1: Rent = 50,000, Paid = 40,000, Balance = 10,000
- Month 2: Rent = 50,000 + Previous balance (10,000) = 60,000 total due

## Benefits of New System

1. **Flexibility**: No fixed lease duration, tenants can stay as long as needed
2. **Accurate Tracking**: Unpaid rent accumulates properly
3. **Monthly Billing**: Clear monthly invoices with accumulated balances
4. **Simplified Booking**: Easier booking process without lease duration selection
5. **Better Cash Flow**: Landlords can track unpaid amounts more effectively

## Database Migration

To apply these changes to an existing database:

```sql
-- Run the migration script
SOURCE smart_rental/database/remove_lease_duration.sql;
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **New Bookings**: Test booking creation without lease duration
2. **Rent Calculations**: Test monthly rent calculation with unpaid balances
3. **Payment Recording**: Test payment recording and balance updates
4. **Invoice Generation**: Test monthly invoice generation
5. **Data Migration**: Test with existing booking data

## Backward Compatibility

- Existing bookings will continue to work
- Monthly rent will be calculated from property price if not set
- Payment history will be preserved
- No data loss during migration
